# README

This app was built with the focus of making it as realistic as possible.  When reading about the features expected I started building out the tables and figuring out the associations.  Once I got the tables and associations in place I started building the app, creating a MVP.  I started by getting some data in the db with the tables I started off with which were the movies, and theaters. Once added, I displayed the data for both tables to their corresponding views.  From there I moved on to the showtime table and displaying each showtime created thats relevant to its corresponding movie.  After getting each of those tables to display their data properly I moved on to creating the order table to purchase the ticket.  I built the model to take in the user information and reduce the seats available by 1.   To finish the app I integrated the email notification through Sendgrid which sends a simple text email to the corresponding user email from the order confirming the purchase.  Once all data was displaying the way I intended I added some updates to the front end to make the app feel clean.
